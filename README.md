# MIT-Pacman-Exercise

### Description: Small javascript application that moves a Pacman image around the screen within the boundaries of the window.

**How to use**: Download repo and open index.html in any js compatible browser. **Click "add pacman"** > **"start game"** to run the script. Additionally, you can click "add pacman" to add as many pacmen as you like to the page.

Roadmap:

Future improvements include:

- Collision detection with other Pacmen
- Randomly add "ghost" instead of pacman
  - Upon collision with ghost, destroy pacman
- Randomly add "fruit" instead of pacman
  - Upon collision with fruit, update pacman to "bonus" mode
  - Upon collision with pacman, consume and increase pacman size
  
  Roadmap dates TBD.
